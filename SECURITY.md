# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Security fixes are only applied to the current master branch.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability in this project, please do report it to [webmaster@lvier.de](mailto:webmaster@lvier.de).

**Important note:** Security vulnerabilities that require access to this repository to be exploitable are explicitly out of scope. Any user with the ability to push to
the `:master` of the `upstream` repository is considered fully trusted! Security vulnerabilities that exclusively affect the build environment or the development
server are of no interest. This includes `@squarespace`, `webpack`, and all of their dependencies.

If you have found an issue, whether valid or not, we will generally get back to you within two business days and in most cases we will fix the issue within 30 days.
Once the fix is applied, we will notify you, in order to grant you the permission to disclose the issue to the general public, should you wish to do so. If you are a
reasearcher, and have not yet heard back from us, we ask you to not disclose the issue to the public. We are a small non-profit and will sometimes not be able to
react immediately, however we do care about security, we are sincerely thankful for you reaching out to us, and we will get back to you as soon as possible.
